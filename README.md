# AMaze - Maze Solver and Generator
A Maze Solver and Generator application utilizing Djikstra's algorithm and Recursive Backtracking.

# Maze Generator
The AMaze is generated using the Recursive Backtracking algorithm. The process involves using the Stack abstract data structure to keep track of the current node and its neighbors. The generator randomly selects a neighboring node to append to the Stack and continues this process until the maze is fully generated.

# Maze Solver
The Maze Solver uses the Djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes. The algorithm calculates the minimum cost to travel in all possible directions and updates the cost of each node. The Queue abstract data structure is used to keep track of the shortest path, and the path is traced backwards after reaching the final destination.

# Technology
The project is implemented with Python and Tkinter library.

# How to Use
Launch the application
Select the option to generate a new maze or input an existing maze
Select the start and end points for the solver
Watch as the solver calculates the shortest path through the maze.
